    A soduku game that includes 3 different boards and a built in solver.

</p>



## How to play
Run the 'SudukoGUI.py' file.

Users can choose which board they want to play on the main menu, and begin a game by pressing the start button.

While in game, users can select squares by clicking on squares that have not yet been solved. When a square is selected, pressing numbers 1-9 will "sketch" that number into the square. If user want to remove the sketch, they can press the DEL key, and if they want to check their sketch against the board solution, they can press ENTER.

If a user gets stuck and they have enough hints left, they can press the "Hint" button with a square selected and the correct number will be placed in that square.

The game ends when the board is solved. This can be done by the user, or pressing the "Solve" button.

## About the project
This project was inspired by the YouTube channel Tech With Tim: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg
It was meant as a way to learn python and create GUI elements with the pygame library, as well as learn an application for the backtracking algorithm.
